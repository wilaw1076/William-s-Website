            <h1><strong>A little about me!</strong></h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m William! I started my academic journey at City College of San Francisco, where I earned my AS in Computer Science, and I’m now continuing at UC Irvine to pursue my bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering. Along the way, I’ve gained experience in C++, Python, and Java, and I’m currently diving deeper into front-end development with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and even frameworks like React.</p>
            <p>My aspirations lie with tinkering and building functional devices—especially when they can make life easier or more enjoyable for others. I consider myself flexible and adaptable, always open to opportunities that help me refine my current skills, achieve mastery, and pick up new ones along the way.</p>
